# 🌲 Random Forest ML - Travel Dataset

A simple implementation of **Random Forest** for predictive modeling on a travel dataset.  
> 📌  "Random Forest model trained to analyze and predict travel-related patterns."

## 📖 What is Random Forest?
Random Forest is an **ensemble machine learning algorithm** that builds multiple decision trees during training and merges their outputs to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.  
- Each tree votes, and the majority decision (for classification) or average (for regression) is taken.  
- It works well on both classification and regression problems.  
- Advantages: Handles missing values, reduces variance, and provides feature importance.

## 📂 Project Contents
- `Travel.csv` → Dataset used for training and testing.  
- `work.pkl` → Pickled Random Forest model.  
- `new.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

## ⚙️ How it Works Here
1. Load and preprocess the **Travel dataset**.  
2. Train a **Random Forest model** on relevant features.  
3. Save the trained model as `work.pkl` for reuse.  
4. Evaluate predictions and analyze feature importance.
